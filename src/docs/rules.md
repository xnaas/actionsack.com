!!! tip
    [@xnaas](https://xnaas.info) can ban you from any platform for any reason at any time.
    The below are just general guidelines. Don't be an asshole and you're probably fine.

### Text Chat (IRC)

1. Don't spam chat
2. Don't advertise

### Voice Chat (Mumble)

1. Use PTT if you can't keep background noise to a minimum
2. If you whistle into your microphone, I will skullfuck you and your entire family
