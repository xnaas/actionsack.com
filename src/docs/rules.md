# Rules

!!! tip
    [@xnaas](https://xnaas.info) can ban you from any platform for any reason at any time.
    The below are just general guidelines. Don't be an asshole and you're probably fine.

### Text Chat (IRC)

1. Never bridge chat to Discord. Ever.
2. Don't spam chat.
3. Don't advertise.

### Voice Chat (Mumble)

1. Use PTT if you can't keep background noise to a minimum.
2. If you whistle into your microphone, I will skullfuck you and your entire family.
